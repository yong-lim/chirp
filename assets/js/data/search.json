Follow me and I hope you get the same results I did.The Steps we will take Install Ruby This will be de DEV Edition Install Jekyll Install Bundler Create our Github Repository We do this by Cloning The Theme to our repository Cloning your new Repo to your PC for Editing. Make some changes to our _config.yml file. Running your site locally. Uploading to Github. Re-Assign our branch for github-pages.Assumptions You must already have GIT Installed. You must already have a text editor. (I recommend Visual Code Is the one used on this tutorial, it’s small and FREE)Installing RubyHead over to rubyinstaller.org and install the DEV version. At time of this tutorial it was version Ruby+Devkit 3.1.2-1 (x64) (choose your version I am on a 64 bit version of Windows 11).Make sure you install EVERYTHING. ScreenshotsDuring the last steps of Ruby installation, a Command window is opened and it asks you to setup “MSYS2”; You will need to do all 3 options one at a time.ScreenshotsOnce you finish is recommended that you reboot your computer.After rebooting you can confirm that Ruby and Gem are installed and accessible anywhere from your command line by typing the following on the command/terminal window. For Ruby. ruby -v For Gem. gem -v As you can see in the above screenshot.The result of ruby -v was: ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [x64-mingw-ucrt]. And for gem -v was: 3.3.7Installing JekyllJekyll is installed using by the following command: gem install jekyllInstalling BundlerBundler is Installed using the following command: gem install bundlerIf you did this correctly you should be able to get their version by doing: jekyll -v bundler -vYou can see my results on the screenshot bellow:Create our Github RepositoryNow we will create our new repository on github and clone the custom theme into it. You can easily install the theme directly using: gem install name-of-custom-theme But apparently it leaves the enduser with having to manage dependancies manually.So by cloning the theme repo directly it makes this unnecesary and easier for us.Head over to the theme repo. In this tutorial we are using Jekyll-Theme-Chirpy This is the same beautiful theme showcased on Techno Tim’s Video.If you read halfway you will find at “STEP 1 - Creating a New Site” that the theme developer has made it easy for us to clone the theme by using his Chirpy StarterScreenshotsChirpy StarterTo host your site for FREE on Github. Your repository must be set as “PUBLIC” and you must name your repo as follow : github-username.github.ioAs you can see in the screenshot above, in my case it’s: jadehawk.github.ioGo ahead and fill in the info with your username.github.io and hit “Create Repository from Template” this will generate a new repository with all the Chirpy Theme dependencies ready for us to use.Cloning your new Repo to your PCOpen up a Terminal / Command Line window and navigate to the root folder where you want to clone the repo to.We will use GIT to clone the repo as follow:git clone HTTPS://REPO-URL.GITHUB.IOYou can get the URL from the repo Code Section in my case it’s: https://github.com/jadehawk/jadehawk.github.io.git See Screenshot below:So my Terminal/Command Line code should look like this: git clone https://github.com/jadehawk/jadehawk.github.io.gitThis will clone your repo locally and we can then navigate to the new folder “username.github.io” and we can see the same content that is on the repo.Make some changes to our _config.ymlWe need to make some changes to the _config.yml file in the root of your freshly cloned repo.The Jekyll-Theme-Chirpy has added a lot of things to this file but we will only concentrate on a few to get us started, the changes are needed in the following spots: timezone: Whatever matches your locale. (ex. America/New_York) title: Replace this with your website Title. (ex. Jadehawk’s Tech Notes) tagline: This will be display under the main title. (ex. A Small Collection Of Tutorials &amp;&amp; Notes) url: This is your Github Pages url (ex. https://jadehawk.github.io) avatar: A URL to your avatar that will be display on the website.Save your changes, the rest of the possible settings can be changed later as they will not affect the way your site is displayed to much.Running Your Site LocallyThe first command we need to run is: bundleThis will install all the extra dependancies listed on the file called “GemFile” and will generate another file called “Gemfile.lock” after it completes successfully. If you already have a “Gemfile.lock” manually delete it before running the commandNow we will start our local webserver and access our local Jekyll site using the address : http://127.0.0.1:4000/We do this by running the following command: bundle exec jekyll sIf all goes well you should see the following on your screen and be able to access a local copy of your jekyll static website.Uploading to GithubAt this very moment in time. Your local copy of the repo is different from the one in github since you already made changes to the _config.yml file.We need to merge (PUSH) our local changes to github, but first we need to add an extra line to our “Gemfile.lock” to include Linux as a platform. Github runs linux and we are on windows. To do this we simple run the following command on our terminal window, inside the root of our cloned repo. bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linuxThen we do the standard 3 commands to upload to GitHub: git add --all git commit -m “add message example: Initial Push” git pushDepending on the amount of changes made, yours will look slightly differentAfter a few minutes on your GitHub Repo, you will noticed that a new branch “gh-pages” was automatically created for you:How this works is that when you do a “PUSH” GitHub will use your main branch as the source and in the background it will temporality install: Linux Ruby jekyll bundlerAnd generates your website. and the result of this will be saved on the “_site” folder whick will be copied to the “gh-pages” branch and publish it to the world.Before we can see the site we need to tell Github that we want to display the “gh-pages” and we do this by editiing the source of “PAGES” on our github repo to match “gh-pages”Once you do this change you will see background change to “Blue” while the site is being redone.After a few minutes this will change to “Green” and your site should be ready for acess at https://username.github.io (Example. https://jadehawk.github.io)" } ]
